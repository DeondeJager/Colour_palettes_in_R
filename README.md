# Colour palettes in R
This repository contains an R script with some examples on how to make and visualize custom colour palettes in R, specifically using the [viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/index.html) and [RColorBrewer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html) packages.
The idea is that the hex colour codes can then be used in other programs to implement a consistent palette across all figures, as not all figures for a manuscript are always made in R.
